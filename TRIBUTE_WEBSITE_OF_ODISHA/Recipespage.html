                    The cuisine of Odisha, popularly known as the Odia Cuisine, is a melange of varied items and practices. Odia cuisine is less oily and spice but a burst of flavours.
                     Aptly called 'the Goa of Eastern India', Odisha is like a quintessential gourmet central for every foodie. 
                     Rice is the staple food of Odisha with mustard oil used as a cooking medium in many households.
